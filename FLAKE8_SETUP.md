# ✅ flake8 Automated Code Quality Setup Complete!

Your Studio Bar Django project now has comprehensive automated code quality checks with flake8.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Check code quality
make lint

# Auto-fix formatting issues
make lint-fix

# Run all checks (lint + tests)
make check-all
```

## 📋 What Was Set Up

### 🛠️ Tools Installed
- **flake8 7.0.0** - Main Python code quality checker
- **flake8-django 1.4.0** - Django-specific linting rules
- **autopep8** - Automatic code formatting

### ⚙️ Configuration Files
- **`.flake8`** - Main configuration (88 char line limit, Django-friendly)
- **`Makefile`** - Easy commands for development workflow
- **`.vscode/settings.json`** - VS Code integration with real-time linting
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** - Automated checks on GitHub
- **`scripts/pre-commit-check.py`** - Pre-commit hook script

### 📊 Current Status
✅ **Fixed Issues:** 
- Removed unused imports (17 issues)
- Fixed whitespace and formatting (24 issues)
