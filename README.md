## UX Design

### Colour Scheme

The site’s colour scheme uses black, red, and white to reflect Studio Bar’s bold, pared-down aesthetic. Black provides depth and atmosphere, red adds contrast and energy, and white ensures clarity throughout. The palette is direct, confident, and visually striking.

### Typography

The site uses the Google Font “Rye” for its text elements. This typeface was selected for its distinctive character and vintage flair, aligning with Studio Bar’s bold visual identity.

### Imagery
